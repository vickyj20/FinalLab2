# Reflective Analysis: Homeless Shelters in Vancouver: Purpose, Limitations, and Choice in Layers and Styling

I designed my map with two purposes in mind, and thus for two group of map users. The first goal is to display the lack of homeless shelters in the larger Vancouver area despite the presence of low-income status populations everywhere. The second goal is to ease the process of aiding vulnerable low-income youth and adults to shelters closest to their homes. 

Expanding on my first goal, I wanted to tangibly show current and future city planners, organizations, community leaders, etc. that there are not very many shelters in the larger Vancouver area besides the Downtown Eastside.  Presently, the location of all homeless shelters is saturated in one area, forcing the populations that require shelter to aggregate there. This can then explain parts of the reason why there are so many individuals living on the streets on the Downtown Eastside. Despite the values and the goodness of these organizations that support the homeless population, there is an underlying effect that is displayed in this map. The idea of “out of sight, out of mind” is pertinent to my explanation. When deciding where to build or host the next homeless shelter, there are social and cultural values at stake – ie. individuals that have higher SES do not want to be living close to a homeless shelter because it will degrade their status and their way of life or the general populations do not want to live close to a homeless shelter because they are afraid of the people –, and those reasons make it easy to forget that these individuals are also human beings with feelings and attachment who have little to no means of efficient transportation (with their items) to their next “home” and may not have the proper attire to protect themselves from harsh conditions. 

In terms of my second goal, I want to aid individuals that want to help the homeless population find a shelter that may be suitable to them ie. male-only shelters, youth shelters, etc. Although, the homeless populations have little to no access to an interactive online map, individuals that wanting to help can use this map to call the shelter’s phone number and get more information or direct them to the shelter themselves. I accomplished this goal by having different toggle layers for the individuals to click through to determine which shelter is the most suitable for them, as well as having a geo-location function which allows for the map to locate the user and display their location on the map providing a visual image of how close they may be to potential shelters. However, the toggle layers only work well when the ‘All Homeless Shelters’ layer is off. Additionally, as the pop-ups only work with the first layer, when the ‘All Homeless Shelters’ is turned off, the pop-ups do not work. Conversely to counteract, the lack of efficient productivity with these functions, on the ‘All Homeless Shelter’ pop-ups, it displays the phone number, the type of shelter (ie. adult and male), and whether the shelter has meals. Thus, there is some interface flexibility between my interactivity functions. Furthermore, I believe that my map displays different levels of interface complexity – starting with the basic stylings and incorporating functions that I believe would aid the users of the map. However, the feedback of several of these functions is not as good as it could be.  
Some of the cartographic stylings that I took into consideration was the zoom level of the icons, using different icons for the toggle layers to account for the lack of an icon legend and the lack of popups, and the decreasing opacity of the ‘Low Income Status’ layer which allows for the user to see the icons more clearly up close. Moreover, I tried to make the colour of the ‘Low Income Status’ as representative as possible, not too bright or dark as it could signify potential happiness (with bright colors) or potential dangers (with dark colours). 

Lastly, there are multiple ways that my map can be improved such as getting the toggle layers to work properly (ie. not just working after one layer is turned off), displaying pop-ups on all layers, and having a more detailed legend. 

# Collaborations
Rithikha R tried to help me with my toggle layer problem, but I was unable to make it function cohesively.
I used the mapbox tutorial codes (provided in Lab 1) for the legend and the title textbox. 
Additionally, I googled some of the code to help some of the interactivity to work:

Link for toggle layers: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/toggle-layers/ ; I used this code and altered the code based on my own information to display the features on my map
